# 🚢 Titanic Data Analysis: Advanced Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, and EDA | Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship

## 📋 Project Overview
This repository contains a complete data analysis of the Titanic dataset using advanced techniques for data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Machine learning (Random Forest) was also used to assess feature importance.

## 📂 Repository Contents
- **titanic_data_analysis.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook file, including all the code for data cleaning, feature engineering, EDA, and model fitting.
- **titanic.csv**: The Titanic dataset. [Download from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Survival Rate by Gender**: Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- **Survival Rate by Class**: Passengers in 1st class had the highest survival rate, while those in 3rd class had the lowest.
- **Feature Importance**: The most important factors for survival prediction were `Sex`, `Pclass`, and `Fare`.

## 💻 How to Use the Notebook
1. Download the `titanic_data_analysis.ipynb` file and the `titanic.csv` dataset.
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to explore the analysis and visualizations.
